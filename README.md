## The Lab Topology
Within this lab, I've carefully structured a real-world-like environment to explore system administration principles. The heart of this setup is a Windows Server 2019 machine, which serves as the domain controller. This powerful server represents the core of any Windows-based network and offers me an excellent platform for diving deep into Active Directory.

Complementing the server is a Windows 10 machine, seamlessly joined to the domain. This configuration provides a holistic understanding of system admin responsibilities, network management, and user account management. It's a practical microcosm of enterprise environments, with the Windows Server 2019 acting as the backbone and the Windows 10 machine as the endpoint.
